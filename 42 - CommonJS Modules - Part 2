// To export objects in Node or CommonJS format is:
// keyword 'module' which refers to the current module, it has a property called 'exports' which is an object. We can add one or more properties to it. So we can add circle and set it to a circle class as below:
// module.exports.Circle = Circle;

// Since I'm exporting a single line, it can be simplified like so:
module.exports = Circle;
// So when we import the circle module we get the Circle class.

// If we had multiple classes and we wanted to export them we can do this:
/*
module.exports.Circle = Circle;
module.exports.Square = Square;
*/
