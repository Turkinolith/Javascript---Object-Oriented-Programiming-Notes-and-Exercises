// *********** Prototypes ***********

// ***** Multilevel inheritance *****
let myArray = [];
// has a prototype property __proto__
// has a bunch of different methods.
// indexOf, push, pop, etc.
// in memory we have "myArray" which derives from, lets call it, arrayBase.
// if we inspect the prototype for it, at the bottom of the __proto__ we see another __proto__ object.
// There, we see the object base.
// So, to visualise we have: [myArray] => [arrayBase] => [objectBase] This is what we call multilevel inheritance.

// Objects Created by a given constructor will have the same prototype.
